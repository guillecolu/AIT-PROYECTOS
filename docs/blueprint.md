## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Steel Blue (#4682B4) to evoke trust, stability, and technical expertise, reflecting the industrial context and precision of machine engineering.
- Background color: Light gray (#D3D3D3), nearly desaturated steel blue, for a professional, clean, and neutral backdrop that enhances readability.
- Accent color: Coral (#FF7F50), an analogous color to the primary, for highlighting key actions, alerts, and progress indicators with a contrasting visual pop.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines, providing a techy, scientific feel, and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text, offering a modern, neutral look suitable for detailed project information and task descriptions.
- Use detailed and specific icons to represent different project components (mechanical, electrical, programming, assembly), task states, and file types to enhance navigation and understanding.
- Responsive design optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile views, with a focus on a clean and readable interface for meeting room displays.
- Subtle transitions and animations to indicate progress and status changes within tasks and projects, such as loading animations and progress bar updates.
